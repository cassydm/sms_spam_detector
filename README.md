# sms_spam_detector

Module 21 Challenge due 10/17/24. Created by Cassy Miller 

This module creates a gradio app used for detecting if SMS messages are spam or not. 
The module uses TfidfVectorizer to convert text into numerical vectors. The model then predicts from the SMSSpamCollection dataset if the input text is spam.

The final app is found in M21_Starter_code/gradio_sms_text_classification.ipynb
